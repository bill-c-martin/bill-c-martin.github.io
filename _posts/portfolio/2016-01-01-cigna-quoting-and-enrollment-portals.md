### Project Description

Cigna had four web applications to facilitate sales of health and dental insurance:

- **Broker Portal** - Agents sell policies, run quotes, and view commissions data
- **Quoting Portal** - Individuals get quotes for health & dental coverage
- **Enrollment Portal** - Individuals enroll in health & dental policies
- **Member Portal** - Members view benefits, make payments, and track claims

### Contributions

My work with Cigna's portals spanned three years, largely driven by new feature requests:

- Support for quoting dental products across ten states
- Add and terminate health products across ten states for quoting & enrollment
- Overhaul the billing calculations and layout for members
- Modify PDF proposals generated with PDFlib

I also created a bulk premium rating tool that allows internal rate analysts to run large data sets through uploadable spreadsheets to test their own quote rating engines.

### Challenges Overcame

This period marked a lot of growth for me as a junior web developer coming from a startup company, getting my feet wet with enterprise-level web applications.

The biggest challenges I faced were mostly enterprise firsts:

- Absorb the vast business domain of health & related insurance
- Implement DB2 cursors to facilitate server-side pagination in result sets
- Write design and test documents
- Collaborate on teams of business analysts, project managers, and QA

There were also technical challenges where I was in over my head:

- Learn an in-house-built MVC framework, also my first MVC framework
- Map values to PDFs proposals using complex XMLs
- Work with AJAX using Prototype to call premium rating web services

### Accomplishments

My biggest personal accomplishment was conquering the huge learning curve of domain knowledge and enterprise exposure as a junior developer.

My longest-lasting application to date is the bulk premium rating tool. It is still in use today and still saves countless hours for a team of rate analysts.

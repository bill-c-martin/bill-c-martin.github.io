### Project Description

[Swell Loyalty & Referrals](https://www.yotpo.com/platform/loyalty/) is a customizable rewards program designed to maximize customer engagement and increase lifetime value on ecommerce platforms by awarding points for actions and purchases which are redeemable as discounts in checkout.

The goal of this project was to develop a custom Wordpress/WooCommerce plugin for hempbombs.com to integrate with Swell through their widgets, JavaScript SDK, and REST API.

### Contributions

My primary contributions involved leading the project:

- Spearheaded project from inception to completion, handling coordination, estimates, and burndown
- Worked with marketing team to help
  - develop requirements based on Swell technical feature set and constraints
  - leverage dynamic Swell widgets on site pages they published.
- Orchestrated and coordinated soft/hard Swell rollout and deployments without issue

As well as developing the whole project:

- Built out Swell API in our Postman team workspace
- Developed custom WooCommerce plugin to integrate with Swell with these touchpoints:
  - Built custom coupon type in WooCommerce exclusively for rewards discounts
  - Synced new WooCommerce account registrations with Swell through their REST API
  - Injected a points redemption feature in cart/checkout for rewards members with points balances
  - Triggered completed or refunded orders to earn points through Swell REST API
  - Built Account area to view rewards history and VIP tiers
- Devised custom tool to generate, load, and synchronize reward coupons on the hempbombs.com WooCommerce and Swell systems.

### Challenges Overcame

The biggest challenge from a logistics standpoint was estimating all the moving parts within 2 unfamiliar systems, setting a target date, and staying on target through burndowns.

The project spanned 4 months with a 2 month development window, and released on time.

From an development perspective, the challenges overcome were mainly due to unfamiliar territory:

- Complexities of WooCommerce's codebase, action/filter hooks, and database structure
- Swell's REST API, JDKs, and general rewards program business domain
- Custom plugin design in Wordpress/WooCommerce that inject at touchpoints all across the site

By the start of the project, I had never done any in-depth customizations in Wordpress or WooCommerce.

The action/filter hook system of Wordpress, as well as the complexity of WooCommerce that sits on top of it, was a bit foreign to me.

### Accomplishments

Business accomplishments:

- 27% participation rate in the customer rewards program
- 21% increase in average order revenue for redeeming customers vs non-redeeming
- 6% revenue increase overall

By the end of the project, I was positioned to be able to advise my team going forard on:

- Wordpress/WooCommerce database complexies and intricacies
- Custom plugin development for Wordpress
- Ins and outs of finding and leveraging action/filter hooks across entire codebase and 3rd party plugins

Lastly, this project ultimately established the architectural approach for custom plugins going forward, which later served as a baseline for numerous other custom plugins developed at the company.

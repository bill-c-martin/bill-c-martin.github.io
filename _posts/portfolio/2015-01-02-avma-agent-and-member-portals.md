### Project Description
AVMA has a multi-user site for agents, students, and members that allows all three to run insurance quotes:

- **Agent Portal** - Agents sell policies, run quotes, and manage sales
- **Student Portal** - Students view coverage, make payments, and get quotes
- **Member Portal** - Members view coverage, make payments, and get quotes

### Contributions

My work with AVMA's portals in 2012 were driven largely by new feature requests:

- Integrate Google Analytics' conversion funnels for the quoting process
- Streamline the quoting process to increase usability
- Add new products for quoting, PDF proposal rendering, and premium rating

### Challenges Overcame

The biggest challenges I faced were with Google Analytics and AVMA's complex product offering:

- Implement Google Analystics and funneling for the first time
- Working with complex rating, plan, and benefit structures previously unexposed to

### Accomplishments

The AVMA portals were the first modular applications I've ever worked with and really opened by eyes for application development in terms of scalability and reusability.
